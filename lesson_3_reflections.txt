When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

  It is always nice to have a backup of your work. Also, putting your work remote
  (on GitHub) makes it easier to share your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Pulling your changes in manually allows you to control when/how to keep your
  local files up-to-date. Having Git do this automatically could cause you to
  have more commits/versions than you may want.
